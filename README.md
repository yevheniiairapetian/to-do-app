## Technologies Used:
- HTNL5
- CSS3
- jQuery
- Bootstrap
- React
- PWA
- Service Worker

## When installed like a Progressive Web App, it allows to:
- Resemble a native-app experience.
- Have an improved user experience
- Experience cross-platform compatibility
- Make use of faster loading times
- Use offline accessibility
- Have a smaller size than a native desktop app
- Access the app quickly via a mobile home screen, a Windows/Mac taskbar, etc

## Project dependencies:
- jQuery for DOM manipulation and interactivity
- React as Javascript library
- Bootstrap for design/responsive design, accordions
- Vercel for deployment

## Live Version:
The app is live [here](https://to-do-min.vercel.app/)

## Clone and Preview
To clone the app use the following command:
```console git clone git@github.com:yevheniiairapetian/to-do-app```
Or download directly by clicking on <> Code button > Download ZIP. Make sure you have Node installed on your machine. To check if you have Node installed, run the ```node -v``` command in the terminal. If Node is not installed, use the preferred package manager:
- For npm on Windows, run the ```npm install nodejs``` command 
- For Mac, run the ```brew install node``` command
- For Linux Debian/Ubuntu-based systems run the ```sudo apt-get install nodejs``` command
- For Red Hat/Fedora-based systems run the ```sudo yum install nodejs```
command
2. Then get back to the project folder and use the ```cd to-do-app``` terminal command. Then run the ```npm i``` command (or similar, depending on the package manager) to install the project dependencies
  3. After that, follow the scripts in the section below.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
